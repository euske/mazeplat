<h1>Automatic Platformer Level Generation</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
I've been experimenting on a platformer game with randomly generated
levels. A randomized game is one of suitable approaches for
short/indie games that can be played repeatedly. There are several
known algorithms for random maze generation in a 2D plane, but a
platformer game has additional requirements that make it a tricky
problem to handle. Our goal is to make a random level that is
solvable, i.e. the player can reach its predetermined goal.  In this
experiment, we used a platformer pathfinding library in order to
guarantee its solvablility. I have a working prototype and its source
code. The source code is published under MIT/X License (i.e. it's
freely available.)

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
The basic algorithm of level generation is the following:
<ol>
<li> Start from an initial (seed) pattern.
<li> Iteratively alter the level while maintaining its solvability.
<li> Stop when the level is good enough.
</ol>
<p>
This problem can be formulated as tree searching. At each step in
stage 2, there are a number of ways to change the configuration, such
as adding a wall, removing a floor, or adding a ladder, etc.  This is
equivalent to traversing a tree with a number of different
branches. It's not practical to consider all the possibilities at
each step because its number can easily grow exponentially, so we
maintain a limited set of the best results only and expand them
iteratively.  This strategy is known as "beam search". Although it
does not guarantee the optimal solution, with a sufficiently good
evaluation funtion it can give good enough results.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

Seed patterns:

Alternation methods:

Evaluation functions: map complexity and path complexity

Now, the question is what map is considered "good"?
